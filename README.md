Set up JDK 8 environment and run `./gradlew build` , make sure to connect to a decent network or downloading will be failed.

## Contributing

Use any Java IDE to contribute this project, gitignore file is pre-configured for Eclipse, IDEA and Visual Studio Code. But I'm only using Visual Studio Code, so working on Eclipse or IDEA is not guaranteed. `./gradlew eclipse` or `./gradlew idea` can be used to generate Eclipse or IDEA configuration, Visual Studio Code configuration can only be created manually.
