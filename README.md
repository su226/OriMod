## Contributing

Use any Java IDE to contribute this project, gitignore file is pre-configured for Eclipse, IDEA and Visual Studio Code. But I'm only using Visual Studio Code for 1.12.2 and IDEA for 1.16.5, working on other IDEs is not guaranteed. `./gradlew eclipse` or `./gradlew idea` can be used to generate Eclipse or IDEA configuration, Visual Studio Code configuration can only be created manually.
